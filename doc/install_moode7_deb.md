# Install instructions for Moode 7

These instructions are for installing mpd_oled with a binary package on
Moode 7 (with a 32-bit kernel architecture).

The binary package should be the best option for most people, but if you
would like to build and install the current mpd_oled repository code then see
[Install instructions for Moode 7 using source](install_moode7_source.md).

## Base system

[Moode](http://moodeaudio.org/) should be installed. Ensure a command line
prompt is available for entering the commands below (e.g. use SSH, enable in
the Moode UI at **Configure / System / Local Services / SSH term server**,
log in with default username 'pi', default password 'moodeaudio').

## System settings

Configure your system to enable I2C or SPI, depending on how your OLED
is connected.

### I2C
I use a cheap 4 pin I2C SSH1106 display with a Raspberry Pi Zero. It is
[wired like this](wiring_i2c.png).

In /etc/modules I have the line `i2c-dev`
```
sudo nano /etc/modules
```

In /boot/config.txt I have the line `dtparam=i2c_arm=on`.
The I2C bus speed on your system may be too slow for a reasonable screen
refresh. Set a higher bus speed by adding
the following line `dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=400000` to
/boot/config.txt, or try a higher value for a higher screen refresh
(I use `dtparam=i2c_arm_baudrate=800000` with a 25 FPS screen refresh)
```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Restart the Pi after making any system configuration changes.

### SPI
I use a cheap 7 pin SPI SSH1106 display with a Raspberry Pi Zero. It is
[wired like this](wiring_spi.png).
In /boot/config.txt I have the line `dtparam=spi=on`.
```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Restart the Pi after making any system configuration changes.

## Install the mpd_oled package

This will download and install the most recent mpd_oled binary package
```
wget http://pitastic.com/mpd_oled/packages/mpd_oled_moode_install_latest.sh
sudo bash mpd_oled_moode_install_latest.sh
```

## Configure song status and time zone

Enable the Moode metadata file, which includes information about the
current song
```
sqlite3 /var/local/www/db/moode-sqlite3.db "update cfg_system set value=1 where param='extmeta'" && mpc add ""

```
Go to the Moode UI and set your timezone at **Moode / Configure / System**.

## Configure a copy of the playing audio for the spectrum display

You may wish to [test the display](#test-the-display) before
following the next instructions.

*The next instruction configures MPD to make a copy of its output to a*
*named pipe, where Cava can read it and calculate the spectrum.*
*This works reliably, but has two disadvantages: the configuration*
*involves patching Moode, which may inhibit Moode upgrades; the spectrum*
*only works when the audio is played through MPD (like music files,*
*web radio and DLNA streaming). Creating a copy of the audio for all*
*audio sources is harder, and may be unreliable -- see the thread on*
*[using mpd_oled with Spotify and Airplay](https://github.com/antiprism/mpd_oled/issues/4)*

Configure MPD to copy its audio output to a named pipe. This is normally
configured in /etc/mpd.conf, but Moode regenerates this file, and also
disables all but a single MPD output, in response to various events. The
following commands therefore change the Moode code to persistently
enable this audio copy.

Copy the FIFO configuration file to /usr/local/etc/mpd_oled_fifo.conf
```
sudo cp /usr/local/share/mpd_oled/mpd_oled_fifo.conf /usr/local/etc/
```

Patch the Moode source code. (Note: you may be able undo the patch and return
to the original Moode code by running the same command but with an extra -R
option i.e. `patch -R -d/...`, you could do this before a Moode update and
then run the original patch command again after the update).
```
sudo patch -d/ -p0 -N < /usr/local/share/mpd_oled/moode/moode7_mpd_fifo.patch  # Patch Moode 7
```

**Essential: reboot the machine**.

## Configure mpd_oled

*Note: The program can be run without the audio copy enabled, in*
*which case the spectrum analyser area will be blank*

The OLED type MUST be specified with -o from the following list:
    1 - Adafruit (SSD1306, SSD1309) SPI 128x64,
    3 - Adafruit (SSD1306, SSD1309) I2C 128x64,
    4 - Seeed I2C 128x64,
    6 - SH1106 (SSH1106) I2C 128x64.
    7 - SH1106 (SSH1106) SPI 128x64.

An example command, for a generic I2C SH1106 display (OLED type 6) with
a display of 10 bars and a gap of 1 pixel between bars and a framerate
of 20Hz is
```
sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o 6 -b 10 -g 1 -f 20
```
The program can be stopped by pressing Control-C.

**For I2C OLEDs** (mpd_oled -o 3, 4 or 6) you may need to specify the I2C
address, find this by running, e.g. `sudo i2cdetect -y 1` and then specify
the address with option -a, e.g. `sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o6 -a 3d ...`.
If you have a reset pin connected, specify the GPIO number with option -r,
e.g. `sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o6 -r 24 ...`. Specify the I2C bus number,
if not 1, with option -B, e.g. `sudo mpd_oled_service_edit -o6 -B 0 ...`

**For, SPI OLEDs** (option -o 1 or 7), you may need to specify your reset pin
GPIO number (option -r, default 25), DC pin GPIO number (option -D,
default 24) or CS value (option -S, default 0).

If your display is upside down, you can rotate it 180 degrees with option '-R'.

Once the display is working, play some music and check the spectrum display
is working and is synchronised with the music. If there are no bars then the
audio copy may not have been configured correctly. If the bars seem jerky
or not synchronized with the music then reduce the values of -b and/or -f.

If you run `sudo mpd_oled_service_edit` without options the service
file will open in an editor, allowing the full service file to be
changed, and not just the mpd_oled options.

If the mpd_oled options are valid the display will be started after
the editor is closed, and will also be configured to start a boot

Check the program is working correctly by looking at the display while
the player is stopped, paused and playing music.


### Extra commands to control the service

A few selected commands that can be used to control the service
```
sudo systemctl enable mpd_oled    # start mpd_oled at boot
sudo systemctl disable mpd_oled   # don't start mpd_oled at boot
sudo systemctl start mpd_oled     # start mpd_oled now
sudo systemctl stop mpd_oled      # stop mpd_oled now
sudo systemctl status mpd_oled    # report the status of the service
```

## Uninstall

Uninstall with
```
sudo apt remove mpd-oled
```
